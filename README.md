# AWS Practice
This project showcases a full-stack machine learning deployment using FastAPI as the backend API and Streamlit as the frontend web application.
A RandomForestClassifier is trained on the classic Iris dataset to predict flower species based on user input.
The backend serves a prediction endpoint, while the frontend provides an interactive UI with sliders and real-time results.
Users can explore the model visually and make predictions through a modern web interface.
Everything runs on an AWS EC2 instance for cloud accessibility and scalability.
